<b>ODIN Collaboration</b>

This project used IllustrisTNG to investigate how protoclusters and the galaxies within them evolve. Protoclusters are used to study cosmological structure formation, galaxy formation physics, and even astrophysical plasmas which make them compelling astronomical objects. I used Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) from the One-hundred-square-degree DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey to trace the specific star formation rate, stellar mass, and other parameters, and compare how their evolution changes depending on the density of their environment. This was my first exposure to cluster evolution and how LAEs can be used both observationally and in simulation to probe clusters as they virialize and evolve. I gained insight into the wide diversity of topics in extragalactic astrophysics that I want to continue to explore. This project also provided perspective on the symbiotic nature between observations and simulations. As a member of the ODIN collaboration, I participated in optical observing runs with DECam where I gained insight to the challenges and care involved in observational astronomy. I am motivated to keep comparing observational data to simulations to analyze the science behind images. I will be presenting the findings of this project at the upcoming AAS in January.
