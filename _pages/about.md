Astronomer at Purdue University
======

I am a current Research Assistant at Purdue University in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. I recieved my B.S. in physics from Purdue University in May 2022. My research interests are studying large scale structures and galaxies with experience in both observation and computation. I am currently working with Professor Dan Milisavljevic at Purdue to process spectra and images taken with JWST MIRI and NIRCam. I am also working with Professor Kyoung-Soo Lee and Maria Celeste Artale to model evolution of Lyman-alpha emitters in protoclusters to compare to the upcoming ODIN (One-hundred-square-degree DECam Imaging in Narrowbands) Survey.
