I am a current graduate student at UC Santa Barbara in the Department of Physics. I recieved my B.S. in physics from Purdue University in May 2022. My primary research interest is in Time Domain Astrophysics and studying supernovae and their progenitor systems. My other interests include studying large scale structures and galaxies with experience in both observation and computation. I am currently working with Professor Andy Howell at the Las Cumbres Observatory.
